# RFID-BASED-AUTHENTICATION-SYSTEM
# NCYS-PROJECT: RFID Attendance System with QR Code Authentication

The **NCYS-PROJECT** is a C++ application developed for secure and efficient attendance management using RFID cards and QR codes. The system allows for the creation of an individual database, RFID card generation, real-time attendance logging, and export of attendance data to CSV files. It includes QR code generation for additional identity verification.

## üîß Functions Overview

### 1. `toLowercase`  
- Converts strings to lowercase  
- Used to standardize role input for users (e.g., "Faculty", "Student")

### 2. `readRFID`  
- Simulates reading an RFID card via user input

### 3. `generateRandomRFID`  
- Generates a unique RFID string based on the input year  
- Ensures every person gets a distinct RFID

### 4. `generateQRCode`  
- Generates a QR code using `qrcodegen` and saves it as an SVG  
- Used when adding new users for secure authentication

### 5. `authenticatePerson`  
- Verifies user identity via RFID matching with the database

### 6. `addPerson`  
- Adds new user to the system  
- Generates RFID and QR code and stores user data

### 7. `exportAttendance`  
- Writes attendance data to a CSV file (`attendance.csv`)  
- Useful for reports or external analysis

### 8. `userMenu`  
- Displays menu options for users to mark attendance

### 9. `main`  
- The main driver function  
- Handles the program's menu, input flow, and function calls

## üîÑ Program Flow

### Option 1: Admin Menu  
- Add a new person (name, role, year)  
- Generates a random RFID  
- Generates and stores a QR code  
- Adds person to the database

### Option 2: User Menu  
- Allows users to mark attendance  
- Performs RFID authentication  
- Displays success message upon successful verification

### Option 3: Show Database  
- Displays all users with details (name, role, RFID, attendance)

### Option 4: Export Attendance  
- Exports the full attendance record to a file named `attendance.csv`

### Option 5: Exit  
- Closes the application
